							It's that time once more: like <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/news.php?id=872" target="_blank">last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/news.php?id=835" target="_blank">the year before</a>, and for time immemorial, ever-prominent community site <a href="https://www.ticalc.org" target="_blank">ticalc.org</a> has opened their Program of the Year competition. Program of the Year, or PotY, allows ticalc.org users to vote on their favorites of all the programs featured in ticalc.org news articles from December 1st of the previous year to November 30th of the current year. Voting takes place in one-week increments, starting with TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus programs, and moving through TI-84 Plus CE/TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition, TI-89/TI-92, TI-Nspire, and computer programs. In past years, there were categories for the TI-82, the TI-85/TI-86, and others, but sadly, we no longer have enough programs in each of those categories for a vote.
<br>
<br>This year, ticalc.org news editor Xavier "<a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/articles/14/148/148865.html" target="_blank">critor</a>" Andréani has spent November catching up on various interesting projects from this year and past years, filling the pipeline of PotY candidates. Like the past years, you can vote by signing in with your ticalc.org account and vote for your favorite program in the poll at the frontpage. You have 7 days to vote, then a new poll will begin. Please, please take a minute to go learn about the programs and go vote! As Travis "<a href="https://www.ticalc.org/about/staff/travise.html" target="_blank">tev</a>" Evans pointed out, if no one votes, there can be no winner. Best of luck to all the authors, congrats for the great projects, and may the best program win.

						#Devember: The Month of Code					</div>

							First off, <a href="https://devember.org/whatisit/" target="_blank">what <i>is</i> Devemeber</a>? Devember is a programming challenge you take up. It is an excuse for programming, for learning to code and for sharing it. We at Cemetech want to encourage you guys to partake in this; we encourage you to not do a calculator project but instead do a web, computer, mobile, or hardware project. This is not a contest but you will be rewarded with new knowledge and personal satisfaction. :P 
<br>
<br>If you wish to partake in this Devember challenge, create a new topic in "<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=4" target="_blank">Your Projects</a>" with the words <b><tt>#Devember: {$MY_PROJECT_NAME}</tt></b> and include the following info in the message body along with the repo you plan to use for your project.
<br>
<br>From here on out I'm going to basically plagiarize the Devember website.
<br>
<br><ul><ul><tt>I, *insert username*, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be *insert objective*. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. 
<br>
<br>*here describe your Devember*</tt></ul>
<br>
<br>What is an Objective?
<br><ul><li>learning programming
<br></li><li>learning Ruby
<br></li><li>programming a game
<br></li><li>programming this game: 'Clowns Inc.'
<br></li><li>programming a tool to manage wifi
<br></li><li>programming a library to record videos
<br></li><li>Anything else you can think of</li></ul>
<br>
<br>In the final section describe more in the detail what your Devember will be. What guide, or book, will you be following. What language, libraries, tools will you be using. What are your plans. You can have the same Devember together with other people! If so write their names in this section.
<br>
<br>Everyone is encouraged to join Devember. From newbies to pro developers. Everyone can learn. Learning is life. Sharing boosts learning. When, in the contract, you agree to keep a devlog, is because of two reasons. In the first instance it gives you a daily motivation to keep faith to the contract, but it also makes you share your experience with everyone else. This means you will get both the feedback from others and their own experiences. And all this is mutual. This is humanities superpower: community learning. It is together that our societies evolved through history. Now, Devember is coming. Will you join the others? Will you join the learning? Will you join the fun? Will you join Devember?
<br>
<br>Put your contract somewhere public. It can be your blog, your Facebook, your Tumblr, your Devember devlog, etc.
<br>
<br>When you write about Devember, please use the hashtag #Devember.</ul>
<br>
<br>We at Cemetech believe that it's a pretty difficult promise. Heck, rewrite that promise a bit so you feel better about keeping it. Maybe instead of everyday, change it to be "I will code 5 hours every week." We won't shun you for breaking the promise so take that promise as seriously as you'd like but at least keep us updated weekly with how (un)helpful your tutorials and resources have been, what new resources you have utilized, what additions and changes you've made, any challenges you are facing or hurdles you foresee, and anything else. Naturally, Devember asks that all projects be open source so please include a GitHub, GitLab, or other repo link in the topic.
<br>
<br>If you're reading someone else's Devember topic please help them out! If they're struggling, point them to some resources, explore their code, etc etc. Offer alternatives and explain why you suggest the change. No one is going to learn when you drop a change with no explanation or suggest new resources without a reason why you think it'll help.
<br>
<br>Below I'll write a sample Devember topic (not one I actually plan to follow through with at this current point in time, sorry!):
<br><hr>
<br><ul>I, Alex, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be learning to develop my own MagicMirror module. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. 
<br>
<br>Most map and traffic modules for the MagicMirror software uses Google Maps, which charges for their API usage. I plan to use OpenStreetMaps to source the data. I plan to support multiple pins as such to mark someones Home, place of Work, and other POI's. I will be using MagicMirrors <a href="https://github.com/roramirez/MagicMirror-Module-Template" target="_blank">Module Template</a> to help with with this as well as various tutorials online to help me navigate OpenStreetMaps API.

							As the USB port for the TI-84 Plus CE and TI 83 Premium CE becomes easier to use, users throughout the community have been eager to connect their calculators to other devices. One such Cemetech member helping to lead the charge is <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=273482#273482" target="_blank">commandblockguy</a>, who has released a USB serial driver, available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/commandblockguy/CE-serial" target="_blank">https://github.com/commandblockguy/CE-serial</a>. This driver allows one to attach a plethora of devices, such as an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and many others as long as they use the standard CDC serial interface. Currently commandblockguy has successfully tested an Arduino link.
<br>
<br>This will hopefully enable users to be able to easily build one of their own similar <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/products/micro-controller/ti-innovator" target="_blank">TI Innovators</a>, along with many other potential uses. Perhaps one day we will see a remote controlled car driven by a TI 84 Plus CE! (Or a real self driving car perhaps?). As one of the first released USB drivers for the latest member of the calculator family, it will be exciting to see where the community will take it.
<br>
<br>The driver is currently implemented in C and assembly, and is easily buildable by downloading the repository and using the <a href="https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases" target="_blank">CE C Toolchain</a>. Most likely you will need a variation of a USB OTG adapter in order to be able to use the driver. Pull requests and feature additions are most welcome, in addition to any bug reports and testing. 
<br>
<br>Let's all give commandblockguy some good vibes and credit, and test out this great new addition to the calculator world!

							It's that time once more: like <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/news.php?id=872" target="_blank">last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/news.php?id=835" target="_blank">the year before</a>, and for time immemorial, ever-prominent community site <a href="https://www.ticalc.org" target="_blank">ticalc.org</a> has opened their Program of the Year competition. Program of the Year, or PotY, allows ticalc.org users to vote on their favorites of all the programs featured in ticalc.org news articles from December 1st of the previous year to November 30th of the current year. Voting takes place in one-week increments, starting with TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus programs, and moving through TI-84 Plus CE/TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition, TI-89/TI-92, TI-Nspire, and computer programs. In past years, there were categories for the TI-82, the TI-85/TI-86, and others, but sadly, we no longer have enough programs in each of those categories for a vote.
<br>
<br>This year, ticalc.org news editor Xavier "<a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/articles/14/148/148865.html" target="_blank">critor</a>" Andréani has spent November catching up on various interesting projects from this year and past years, filling the pipeline of PotY candidates. Like the past years, you can vote by signing in with your ticalc.org account and vote for your favorite program in the poll at the frontpage. You have 7 days to vote, then a new poll will begin. Please, please take a minute to go learn about the programs and go vote! As Travis "<a href="https://www.ticalc.org/about/staff/travise.html" target="_blank">tev</a>" Evans pointed out, if no one votes, there can be no winner. Best of luck to all the authors, congrats for the great projects, and may the best program win.

						#Devember: The Month of Code					</div>

							<span class="boldsmalltext">Published by Alex on November 26, 2018 at 4:08:36 PM CST

							First off, <a href="https://devember.org/whatisit/" target="_blank">what <i>is</i> Devemeber</a>? Devember is a programming challenge you take up. It is an excuse for programming, for learning to code and for sharing it. We at Cemetech want to encourage you guys to partake in this; we encourage you to not do a calculator project but instead do a web, computer, mobile, or hardware project. This is not a contest but you will be rewarded with new knowledge and personal satisfaction. :P 
<br>
<br>If you wish to partake in this Devember challenge, create a new topic in "<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=4" target="_blank">Your Projects</a>" with the words <b><tt>#Devember: {$MY_PROJECT_NAME}</tt></b> and include the following info in the message body along with the repo you plan to use for your project.
<br>
<br>From here on out I'm going to basically plagiarize the Devember website.
<br>
<br><ul><ul><tt>I, *insert username*, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be *insert objective*. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. 
<br>
<br>*here describe your Devember*</tt></ul>
<br>
<br>What is an Objective?
<br><ul><li>learning programming
<br></li><li>learning Ruby
<br></li><li>programming a game
<br></li><li>programming this game: 'Clowns Inc.'
<br></li><li>programming a tool to manage wifi
<br></li><li>programming a library to record videos
<br></li><li>Anything else you can think of</li></ul>
<br>
<br>In the final section describe more in the detail what your Devember will be. What guide, or book, will you be following. What language, libraries, tools will you be using. What are your plans. You can have the same Devember together with other people! If so write their names in this section.
<br>
<br>Everyone is encouraged to join Devember. From newbies to pro developers. Everyone can learn. Learning is life. Sharing boosts learning. When, in the contract, you agree to keep a devlog, is because of two reasons. In the first instance it gives you a daily motivation to keep faith to the contract, but it also makes you share your experience with everyone else. This means you will get both the feedback from others and their own experiences. And all this is mutual. This is humanities superpower: community learning. It is together that our societies evolved through history. Now, Devember is coming. Will you join the others? Will you join the learning? Will you join the fun? Will you join Devember?
<br>
<br>Put your contract somewhere public. It can be your blog, your Facebook, your Tumblr, your Devember devlog, etc.
<br>
<br>When you write about Devember, please use the hashtag #Devember.</ul>
<br>
<br>We at Cemetech believe that it's a pretty difficult promise. Heck, rewrite that promise a bit so you feel better about keeping it. Maybe instead of everyday, change it to be "I will code 5 hours every week." We won't shun you for breaking the promise so take that promise as seriously as you'd like but at least keep us updated weekly with how (un)helpful your tutorials and resources have been, what new resources you have utilized, what additions and changes you've made, any challenges you are facing or hurdles you foresee, and anything else. Naturally, Devember asks that all projects be open source so please include a GitHub, GitLab, or other repo link in the topic.
<br>
<br>If you're reading someone else's Devember topic please help them out! If they're struggling, point them to some resources, explore their code, etc etc. Offer alternatives and explain why you suggest the change. No one is going to learn when you drop a change with no explanation or suggest new resources without a reason why you think it'll help.
<br>
<br>Below I'll write a sample Devember topic (not one I actually plan to follow through with at this current point in time, sorry!):
<br><hr>
<br><ul>I, Alex, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be learning to develop my own MagicMirror module. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. 
<br>
<br>Most map and traffic modules for the MagicMirror software uses Google Maps, which charges for their API usage. I plan to use OpenStreetMaps to source the data. I plan to support multiple pins as such to mark someones Home, place of Work, and other POI's. I will be using MagicMirrors <a href="https://github.com/roramirez/MagicMirror-Module-Template" target="_blank">Module Template</a> to help with with this as well as various tutorials online to help me navigate OpenStreetMaps API.

							As the USB port for the TI-84 Plus CE and TI 83 Premium CE becomes easier to use, users throughout the community have been eager to connect their calculators to other devices. One such Cemetech member helping to lead the charge is <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=273482#273482" target="_blank">commandblockguy</a>, who has released a USB serial driver, available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/commandblockguy/CE-serial" target="_blank">https://github.com/commandblockguy/CE-serial</a>. This driver allows one to attach a plethora of devices, such as an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and many others as long as they use the standard CDC serial interface. Currently commandblockguy has successfully tested an Arduino link.
<br>
<br>This will hopefully enable users to be able to easily build one of their own similar <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/products/micro-controller/ti-innovator" target="_blank">TI Innovators</a>, along with many other potential uses. Perhaps one day we will see a remote controlled car driven by a TI 84 Plus CE! (Or a real self driving car perhaps?). As one of the first released USB drivers for the latest member of the calculator family, it will be exciting to see where the community will take it.
<br>
<br>The driver is currently implemented in C and assembly, and is easily buildable by downloading the repository and using the <a href="https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases" target="_blank">CE C Toolchain</a>. Most likely you will need a variation of a USB OTG adapter in order to be able to use the driver. Pull requests and feature additions are most welcome, in addition to any bug reports and testing. 
<br>
<br>Let's all give commandblockguy some good vibes and credit, and test out this great new addition to the calculator world!
